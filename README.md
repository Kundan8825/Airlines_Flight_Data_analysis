# ✈️ Airlines Flight Data Analysis Using Python & MySQL

Welcome to the **Airlines Flight Data Analysis** project repository! This project utilizes **Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn**, and **MySQL** to explore airline flight data and derive actionable insights about pricing trends, flight routes, and airline performance.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to uncover meaningful patterns and trends in airline ticket prices and flight routes. By analyzing various attributes such as **airline, class type, duration, stops, source/destination cities, and days left before departure**, we aim to offer strategic insights into flight operations and pricing models.

## 📈 Key Findings

- Explored **3 Lakhs+ flight records** to uncover trends in ticket pricing.  
- Built **20+ visualizations** showing pricing trends, busiest routes, and class comparisons.  
- Used **SQL** to extract insights:  
  - Average ticket price per airline  
  - Top 5 most expensive routes  
  - Cheapest airlines for Business class  
  - Flight duration and pricing relationships  
- Identified that **non-stop flights are the most expensive**, while **ticket prices drop as days left before departure increase**.

## 💻 MySQL Capabilities Demonstrated

- Created schema and loaded airline dataset.  
- Executed **advanced SQL** queries:  
  - Price trends by airline and class  
  - Incoming vs outgoing flights per city  
  - Most frequent routes and busiest airlines  
  - Standard deviation analysis for price variation  
- Used **aggregate functions, subqueries, HAVING, GROUP BY, ORDER BY**, and **window functions (ROW_NUMBER)**.
